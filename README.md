  ¡Bienvenidos! En esta ocasión, realizare un trabajo situandome en el rol de un ***Data Analyst***.

## **Contexto y rol a desarrollar**

### **Context**

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic had significant implications on the international financial market, with a marked movement of investments towards technology companies and monetary issuance by governments to help those whose incomes were affected. This led to a hyper-liquidity at a global level and an increase in migration to the US dollar, causing many developing countries to see their debts in dollars become more expensive. Additionally, there is uncertainty regarding the global economic situation and the impact of other geopolitical events. In the financial market, governments and companies can obtain financing while individuals can invest their savings and earn profits.

 
### Rol a desarrollar

The task at hand is to simulate a scenario where a company that wants to invest in the stock market requests a detailed analysis. Since the company has no knowledge of this financial area, they request an explanation of what has happened in this market in recent years (considering positive and negative impacts since the year 2000), investment recommendations (either focused on companies or their sectors), and other complementary information.

Due to the large number of companies in the stock market, the analysis is requested to be limited to companies belonging to the SP500 index ([Standard & Poor's 500 Index]).

Thus, the main objective is to understand the situation of the stock market in the last 23 years based on the aforementioned points, allowing you as a Data Analyst to provide a context of the situation and generate investment recommendations.

The following are the main events that have occurred in the S&P 500 stock market index over the last few years:

2000-2002: The S&P 500 experienced a significant decline due to the dot-com bubble burst and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The US economy went into recession and the S&P 500 lost about 50% of its value.

2003-2007: The stock market recovered during this period thanks to the accommodative monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve and rising commodity prices. The S&P 500 had strong growth, reaching an all-time high in October 2007.

2008-2009: The stock market experienced another significant decline due to the global financial crisis and the ensuing economic recession. The S&P 500 fell more than 50% from its 2007 peak.

2010-2012: The stock market gradually recovered during this period due to the accommodative monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve and rising corporate earnings. The S&P 500 had sustained growth and surpassed its all-time high in April 2012.

2013-2015: The stock market continued its recovery during this period, driven by low interest rates, rising corporate earnings, and global economic growth. The S&P 500 had steady growth and reached new all-time highs.

2016-2019: The stock market experienced record expansion during this period due to the US tax reform, rising corporate earnings, and global economic growth. The S&P 500 had steady growth and reached new all-time highs.

2020: The stock market experienced a significant decline in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures implemented to slow its spread. However, thanks to accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus packages, the stock market quickly recovered, and the S&P 500 closed the year with positive growth.

2021: The stock market continued its recovery during this period due to global economic recovery, low interest rates, and rising corporate earnings. The S&P 500 reached new all-time highs.
